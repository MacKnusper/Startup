# Startup
-----*My first Python Script for starting a new Project + Open an old script*-----

Copy the line of code in the init.py to your own init.py in your ".nuke" folder. 


If you want the panel to always show your own standard path, change it in the Python File to your own. 

In the Open-Tab I added an extra filter String, so you can easily filter all your .nk Files. 
To be more specific, you can write your standard endings to filter the files in the dropdown you want to open. 
When choosing your Project folder, always choose the folder at the highest folder level, because the tool will only look in all the subdirectories. 

BE CAUTIOUS: only press "Generate folders" if you Set your Project Directory by pressing the "Set" Button. 
otherwise you will end up with a bunch of folders in your Nuke program directory. *Fix coming soon
